MU:
 Vs May: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjY0AIc3rF4&t=18041s
  - patient play at round start and midscreen, lots of waiting and jump back
  - Not contesting pressure, just IBing mids
  - Using 236P to wall her off outside of 3K range
  - Only summoning Fish fullscreen
  - Bursting air HKD ender
  - Using 66 5K as primary poke
  - Prefers 214H 669 jS oki, avoiding IAD without multiple projectiles to cover
  - late 2S antiairs
  - Boxing may in to the corner rather than chasing
  - IADB jD to cover chases
  - Staying grounded in close range with projectiles out to 4S may in the air

Vs Ram: https://www.youtube.com/live/ZjY0AIc3rF4?si=5ZafD779Fk4bToKr&t=17852
  - Respect when in Darou range
  - Jump back round start

Vs Chipp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_2YsLr9L4k&t=25387s /25133s
  - IADB jD to cover teleport
  - dl fS roundstart
  - 5H to block grounded approach
  - 6H enders where available
    * ie. Throw IAD jKSD 6H
  - (on 6H/236H oki) opt for spaced j236K oki followed by 214P to stay out of DP range
    * Alternatively, 421H/j236K > fish YRC
  - IB jH to throw low option
  - Neutral j236K set > jH > IAD behind it to approach
  - Neutral j236P set > AD jH > IADB jP to pop bubble
  - fS hits Leaf Grab startup
  - Don't chase, just wall off with safe preemptive options

Vs Slayer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCl8m8FThv0&t=419s
  - 4S/5K dandy approach
  - 214H 669 jS (AD) or 66 214H 66 2K oki
    * Metered, 236K YRC/j236K 214P YRC oki
  - rising/IADb jD and jP to stuff slayer air approach
  - Summon > neutral jump, preferably behind 214D
  - Bursting framekill oki
  - YRC oki to eat BDC
  - j214H j236K to cover approach full screen
  - 421H Super unblockable beats BDC inputs
  - Mix up IADB 2x with IADB AD once Slayer is approaching grounded
  - Make Slayer overchase and then set P bubble to punish
  - Backdash midscreen to avoid pressure, but dont immediately act out of it
  - When unable to set safe projectile oki, 214D 5H/2H or 214D wait
  - (Fish) j236K 421S zoning
    * 421S outside 2K range with 214D or j236K
  - Wait after midrange summons, throw step dash
  - Dont try to chase hard to confirm hits, just back off and use the + frames to summon
  - 2S instead of 6P antiair
