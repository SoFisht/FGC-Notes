https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5a35QNcuSs&t=10s

Roundstart:
- IADB > j236P/ADF
- IB 66 > FD/poke

Neutral:
- IAD j236P to bait anti-airs
  * ADB jS if they dont do anything
- far Tech: j214D 236P > land/ADF
- vs Approach 2S: back dash 2D
- Mix dash jump/dl AD/IAD approaches
- j236P dash jump > normal to pop bubble
- $tang doesn't IB air balls layer 1
  * Instead:
      Dodges with air movement
      Plays aggro to prevent setting

Defense:
- FD normals, IB balls
- IAD or forward jump FD instead of neutral jump jumpout
- After close ball set: mid blitz normal that would hit ball
- Blitz > Jump vs balls
- Don't overly respect venom buttons at tipper range
- Mirror vs charged ball oki to reflect
  * Can be baited by hitting ball with a light (doesnt stay active to be reflected)

Offense:
- Stagger pressure instead of resummons without meter
  * Rebuy with bubble, optionally YRC
- 2P/2K > 236S YRC
  * Also 5H/2D, but different purpose
  * Alt, 214P YRC to buy turn instead of frametrap when they respect

Oki:
- (...2D/Raw Throw) 214H mixup
  * enforce with 669 jS, 236S YRC
  * Discourse blitz with dl 66 j236K AD or IAD dl j236P 
- (6H) 421S IAD crossup
  * Auto timed; can also do 421S > Fish
